"""
Given an M x N matrix .In the given matrix, you have to print the elements of the matrix in the snake pattern.

i des
First line contains two space separated integers M,N,which denotes the dimensions of matrix.
Next for each M lines contains N space separated integers,denotes the values. 

Odes
print the snake



Exp
From sample
the first row is printed as same and the second row is appended reversed with the first.
1 2 3 7 6 5

Hin
We traverse all rows. For every row, we check if it is even or odd. If even, we print from left to
right else print from right to left.
