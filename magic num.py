"""
A magic number is defined as a number which can be expressed as a power of 5 or sum of unique powers of 5. First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.
Write a function to find the nth Magic number.

Hint
If we notice carefully the magic numbers can be represented as 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 etc, where 001 is 0*pow(5,3) + 0*pow(5,2) + 1*pow(5,1). So basically we need to add powers of 5 for each bit set in given integer n.
Exp
2nd magic num is 25
