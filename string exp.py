"""
Given a string consisting of only 0, 1, A, B, C where
A = AND
B = OR
C = XOR
Calculate the value of the string assuming no order of precedence and evaluation is done from left to right.

Constraints â€“ The length of string will be odd and less than 10. It will always be a valid string.
Example, 1AA0 will not be given as an input.

1 AND 0 OR 1 = 1

Hint
The idea is to traverse all operands by jumping a character after every iteration. For current operand str[i], check values of str[i+1] and str[i+2], accordingly decide the value of current subexpression.
