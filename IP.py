"""
Given an IP address as input, write a program to check whether the given IP Address is Valid or not.
Note:
Every computer connected to the Internet is identified by a unique four-part string, known as its Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address (version 4) consists of four numbers (each between 0 and 255) separated by periods. The format of an IP address is a 32-bit numeric address written as four decimal numbers (called octets) separated by periods; each number can be written as 0 to 255 (E.g. â€“ 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255).

Output: Valid Ip address

Input: 110.234.52.124
Output: Valid Ip address

Input: 666.1.2.2

Valid Ip address

Exp
From sample:
all part's number is less than 256

Hint
