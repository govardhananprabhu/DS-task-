"""
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

In des
First line contain integer N,denotes dimension of matrix
Next N line contains N space separated zeroes.

Ot des
Print the N*N board with 1 denotes queen in matrix

Exp
From sample
The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed. Following is the output matrix for above 4 queen solution.

              { 0,  1,  0,  0}
              { 0,  0,  0,  1}
              { 1,  0,  0,  0}
              { 0,  0,  1,  0}

Hint
Generate all possible configurations of queens on board and print a configuration that satisfies the given constraints.
