"""
Suppose we have an array.The content of the array is such that the first of the entries are 1s and the rest are all 0s. Write a function which will take this array as a parameter and return the number of 0s.

In des
The first line contains an integer N, where N is the size of the array A[ ].
The second line contains N space separated integers of all 1's follwed by all the 0's, denoting elements of the array A[ ].
ot des
Print out the number of 0's in the array.

Exp
From sample
there are 2 0s in given array

Hint
A simple solution is to traverse the input array. As soon as we find a 0, we return n â€“ index of first 0. Here n is number of elements in input array.
