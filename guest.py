Exp
From sample:
First guest in array arrives at 1 and leaves at 4, 
second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.
There are maximum 3 guests at time 5.  


Hint
The idea is to consider all events (all arrivals and exits) in sorted order. Once we have all events in sorted order, we can trace the number of guests at any time keeping track of guests that have arrived, but not exited.
